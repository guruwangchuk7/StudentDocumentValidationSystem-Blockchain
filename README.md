# StudentDocumentValidationSystem-Blockchain

# 🚀 Project Overview

The **Student Certificate Validation DApp** is a decentralized application that enables educational authorities to issue student certificates securely and allows companies to verify them with confidence.
The system uses **Ethereum blockchain** and **IPFS** for immutable and tamper-proof storage of certificate data.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Many people and organizations struggle to verify the authenticity of certificates.
Traditional systems are often **slow, costly**, and **vulnerable to fraud**, affecting employers, schools, and students alike.

---

## 🔑 Key Questions & Answers

### What traditional centralized problem are you solving with decentralization?

By storing certificates on **IPFS** and registering them on the **Ethereum blockchain**, we eliminate reliance on a single institution. Employers can verify certificates instantly—**no third-party or university contact required.**

### How does your application empower users with data ownership?

Students control their own verified, immutable certificates via IPFS. Once issued, universities cannot modify or revoke them—ensuring **permanent, tamper-proof proof of education.**
This grants **global shareability and user-owned credentials**.
